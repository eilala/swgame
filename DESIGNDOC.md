Game Design & Technical Plan: Starfall: Capital Clash
1. Core Concept

Starwars Capital Clash is a session-based, multiplayer space combat game for the web. Players are divided into two teams, the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire, and pilot iconic starfighters in a large-scale battle. The ultimate objective is to work with your team to destroy the enemy's capital ship while defending your own.

    Genre: 3D Multiplayer Space Combat

    Platform: Web Browser (PC focus)

    Core Loop: Spawn in hangar -> Fly into battle -> Attack enemy fighters and capital ship subsystems -> Get destroyed -> Respawn -> Repeat until a capital ship is destroyed.

2. Gameplay Mechanics
Flight & Controls

The flight model should be accessible and arcade-like, prioritizing fun over pure simulation.

    Movement:

        W / S: Accelerate / Decelerate (Ship based max acceleration)

        A / D: Roll Left / Right

        Mouse: Pitch and Yaw (aiming)

        Shift: Afterburner (drains weapon energy)

        X: Rear View

        MouseLeft: Primary Weapon

        MouseRight: Missiles/Torpedoes


Factions & Asymmetrical Balance

The two factions will have distinct characteristics to encourage different playstyles.

    Rebel Alliance (X-Wing)

        Pros: Has regenerating shields, durable hull. Balanced speed and maneuverability.

        Cons: Larger target profile.

    Galactic Empire (TIE Fighter)

        Pros: Extremely fast and agile, small target profile.

        Cons: No shields, very weak hull (dies in 1-2 hits). Relies on evasion.

Capital Ships & Objectives

The capital ships are the central focus of the match. They are not just static objects but active participants in the battle.

    Ships: Mon Calamari Cruiser (Rebels) vs. Imperial Star Destroyer (Empire).

    Win Condition: The first team to destroy the enemy capital ship wins.

    Subsystems: Instead of a single health bar, capital ships have targetable subsystems. All subsystems must be destroyed to win. This creates strategic priorities.

        Shield Generators: Must be destroyed first. While active, they make the hull and other subsystems invulnerable.

        Turbolaser Turrets: Automated defenses that fire on enemy players. Can be destroyed to create safer attack vectors.

        Hangar Bay: Destroying this could temporarily increase enemy respawn times.

        Bridge/Command Center: The final target. Destroying this triggers the ship's destruction sequence.

3. Technical Architecture
Graphics: Three.js

Three.js is perfect for rendering the 3D environment.

    Scene: The space environment, including a skybox, the two capital ships, and any environmental objects (e.g., asteroids).

    Assets: Use the GLTFLoader for importing 3D models of ships. Keep models low-poly for performance.

    Effects: Use particle systems for laser bolts, explosions, and engine trails.

Physics: Custom vs. Rapier.js

Short Answer: You likely do not need Rapier.js to start.

    Why a full physics engine (Rapier) is overkill:

        Space combat doesn't involve complex physics like gravity, friction, or joint constraints.

        The overhead of a full physics engine could impact performance, especially with many players and projectiles.

    Recommended Approach: Custom Lightweight Physics

        Movement: Handle ship movement using simple vector math (position, velocity, acceleration). This gives you full control over the "feel" of the flight model.

        Collision Detection: Use simple geometric checks. Bounding spheres are perfect for this. Each ship, projectile, and subsystem has an invisible sphere around it. The server just needs to check if these spheres are intersecting to register a hit. This is computationally cheap and effective.

Networking: Authoritative Server

This is the most critical and complex part. A client-server model is essential to prevent cheating and keep the game state consistent.

    Server: A Node.js server using a library like ws for WebSockets.

    Server's Role (Authoritative):

        Receives player inputs (e.g., "Player 1 is pressing W and firing").

        Runs the game simulation, including all physics and combat logic.

        Is the single source of truth for everything (player positions, health, etc.).

        Broadcasts the updated game state to all clients at a regular tick rate (e.g., 20 times per second).

    Client's Role:

        Renders the game state received from the server.

        Captures user input and sends it to the server.

        Uses techniques like interpolation and client-side prediction to smooth out movement and hide network latency, making the game feel responsive.

4. Development Phases

This project should be built incrementally.

    Phase 3: Real Combat

        Implement health, shields, and damage logic on the server.

        Sync hit detection and destruction events.

        Add player respawning after being destroyed.

        Add the large capital ship models to the scene (still static).
        Goal: A functional team deathmatch.

    Phase 4: The Objective

        Implement the capital ship subsystems on the server.

        Add automated turrets to the capital ships.

        Implement the team system and the win condition.

        Build the necessary UI/HUD (health, shields, target info).
        Goal: The full, objective-based game loop is playable.

    Phase 5: Polish & Expansion

        Refine networking with prediction/interpolation to improve smoothness.

        Add visual effects (explosions, impacts) and sound effects.

        Create a simple pre-game lobby.

        (Future) Add more ships (TIE Interceptor, A-Wing) and a ship selection screen.
